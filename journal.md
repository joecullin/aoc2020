## Day 10

First hard day.

I had what a working part 2 solution, using constant memory even after letting it run 6 hours, but it would've taken 1200 hours to complete.
Saved that as solutions/10.2.slow.js.

Broke down and peeked at some hints:

It was hard to un-see the elegance of the second one. I forced myself to re-type it after glancing at it, but mine is basically an exact copy of it.

## Day 1

I like being able to run each puzzle independently for troubleshooting and for clarity, but the overhead got annoying last year.

Trying a little bit of a wrapper to make that less tedious.

## Setup


Getting started a little late, on Dec 2.

Last year I set a constraint of using no modules. I think I'll drop that this year.
