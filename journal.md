## Day 13

I knew this would be something like 2019's Day 12 where a simple math insight would make it super quick, but I was too stubborn to google and read hints.

So I let it run while I went out for the day. Came home 10 hours later and it had just finished.

I came up with a couple of other small optimization ideas while I was out, but didn't bother pursuing them since I had my correct answer.

## Day 12

Another day where the straightforward approach worked fine. I thought I might have to figure out more elegant geometry (or do more ugly brute force) for part 2, but it wasn't too bad.

## Day 11

I blasted out a quick-and-dirty solution for part 1, fully expecting to need a totally different approach for part 2.

I don't know if I was relieved (easy win) or disappointed (wanted a challenge) when part 2 was unveiled. I kept the same O(something_big) approach and it finished quickly.

I'm sure I could come up with something faster or more elegant, but I'm going to take the easy win and call it a night.

## Day 10

First hard day.

I had what a working part 2 solution, using constant memory even after letting it run 6 hours, but it would've taken 1200 hours to complete.
Saved that as solutions/10.2.slow.js.

Broke down and peeked at some hints:

It was hard to un-see the elegance of the second one. I forced myself to re-type it after glancing at it, but mine is basically an exact copy of it.

Added eslint and did some cleanup. To check all:

`npm run lint`

## Day 1

I like being able to run each puzzle independently for troubleshooting and for clarity, but the overhead got annoying last year.

Trying a little bit of a wrapper to make that less tedious.

## Setup


Getting started a little late, on Dec 2.

Last year I set a constraint of using no modules. I think I'll drop that this year.
