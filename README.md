# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2020

Code is in the solutions directory.

Initial setup:
```
npm install
```

Run a puzzle, for example the second part of day one:
```
./run.js --puzzle=1.2
```

My inputs are (in the inputs dir) are used by default.
If you want to use a different input, either pipe it in as stdin or specify a file with the --input parameter.
```
pbpaste | ./run.js --puzzle=1.2

./run.js --puzzle=1.2 --input=./my-test-file.txt
```

I'm logging some notes & thoughts in [journal.md](journal.md).
